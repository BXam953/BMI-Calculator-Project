# BMI Tracker — Full-Stack Health Tracking App

**BMI Tracker** is a full-stack web application developed using **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and a relational **SQL database**. It allows users to register, log in, and manage their Body Mass Index (BMI) records through a secure and responsive interface.

This project demonstrates secure authentication, RESTful CRUD operations, and SQL-backed data persistence — all wrapped in a polished frontend built with Next.js.

> 💡 Built independently as a real-world portfolio project to showcase full-stack web development skills, including auth, API development, SQL design, and deployment.
